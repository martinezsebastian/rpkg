The goal of rpkg is to â€¦

## Installation

Maybe some day you will be able to install the released version of rpkg
from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("rpkg")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("martinezsebastian/rpkg")
```

These are also a whole bunch of things I can do.
