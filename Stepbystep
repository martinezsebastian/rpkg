Step by step



# Include data
Place raw dataset in the raw-data folder
Manipulate data

run 
    usethis::use_data(datafile, overwrite = TRUE)

Write documentation in a new file, call it data.R, store it in the "R" folder
We need to do this because the data file does not have a place for us to write the documentation, so we have to do it separately
Then we run:
    devtools::document()
so that we can load the documentation
Â¿This runs roxygen2?

The last line has the name of the dataset


# Creating a function
Make a function file
save the function

run
    sinew::makeOxyFile("R/functionname.R")

This reads the function and creates an oxy_functionname.R file which contains the original function and the template for the documentation. Copy the contents from this oxy_functionname.R into functionname.R, and fill out what's necessary



Final stage:
run
    devtools::document()
