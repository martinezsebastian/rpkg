Step by step



# Include data
Place raw dataset in the raw-data folder
Manipulate data

run 
usethis::use_data(datafile, overwrite = TRUE)

Write documentation in a new file, call it data.R, store it in the "R" folder
We need to do this because the data file does not have a place for us to write the documentation, so we have to do it separately
Then we run:
devtools::document()
so that we can load the documentation
Â¿This runs roxygen2?
